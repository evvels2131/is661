                    Been here twice now. Fireside feels like an upscale Friday's. It's a
                    nice atmosphere between the restaurant end, the bar, and individual
                    tables depending on the types of parties you are having. I've seen
                    baseball teams meet here, groups of guys or girls or couples. It's a
                    nice environment for everyone. The prices really aren't that bad
                    either. Service is fast, especially if you sit at the bar.
                    #[br] #[br]The last time I was here, I ordered a balsamic chicken sandwich
                    with arugula lettuce and mozzarella cheese. Delicious! Also have
                    had their waffle sweet potato fries. Crispy and just the right amount
                    of salt. My friend likes their wings. Good grub food with a cold
                    beverage hits the spot. I would return for sure.
